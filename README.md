# BuildTools-Starter
## A starter GUI for BuildTools

Build your fresh compiled Spigot server via GUI operations.

This project is only for using BuildTools, not for installing or updating.

Currencly there are one unsolved problem: The BuildTools output will be where the Starter is, not matter where are the BuildTools.jar
